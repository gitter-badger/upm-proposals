# upm-proposals
Contains proposals for upm-server and upm.
Proposals provide a more structured way of proposing new features, fixes, enhancements et al than issues do.
All proposals are stored as files, and if a proposal is added to this repo (through a pull request), it counts as accepted.
Also a nicer way to log all changes made.
